# How it Works?
# 1) Customer Login:-
In Easy Bank, there are two login tabs: one for customers and one for bankers. For customer login, you need to create an account and then login. The email ID should end with `@gmail.com`.

# 2) Banker Login:-
In the second tab, banker login, you need to create an account with an email ID that ends with `yahoo.com`. Once created, you can access all the transactions of the customers. For trial purposes, 
you can use the following banker login credentials: ID: `johndoe@yahoo.com` and password: `12345`.

# Easy Bank (Banking Application)
# Description
The Bank Database consists of two tables, namely Users and Accounts. It is designed to handle customer and banker interactions for a banking system. The Users table stores information about all users, including bankers and customers, while the Accounts table keeps track of cash deposits and withdrawals.

# Features

The Bank Database provides the following features:
# 1)Customer Login

-Login Page: Users can log in using their username/email and password.

-Access Token: An access token is generated upon login, which is used for authorization in subsequent API requests.

# 2)Transactions Page

-View Transactions: Customers can view their transaction records.

-Deposit and Withdraw: Customers can deposit or withdraw cash from their accounts.

-Available Balance: The popup shows the available balance before making a deposit or withdrawal.

-Validation: If the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance, an "Insufficient Funds" message is displayed.

# 3)Banker Login

-Accounts Page: Bankers can view all customer accounts.

-Transaction Details: Bankers can click on a specific user to view their transaction history.

# Technology Used
The Bank Database is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The technology stack includes:

-Database: `MangoDB database management system`.

-Backend Framework: `Node.js` with `Express.js` for handling API requests.

-Frontend Framework: `React` for building the user interface.

-UI Library: `Material-UI` for designing responsive and intuitive UI components.

-Authentication: `JSON Web Tokens (JWT)` for secure user authentication and authorization.

-API Testing: Tools like `Postman` can be used to test the API endpoints.```
